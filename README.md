# Campus Network Traffic Visualizer
## Overview 🕶️
Welcome to the Campus Network Traffic Visualizer project repository! This project is a fundamental visualization of a campus network topology, demonstrating how packets are transferred between various devices. The primary tool used for this visualization is Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Description 😄
The Campus Network Traffic Visualizer provides an insightful look into the dynamics of network traffic within a campus setting. By simulating a typical campus network environment, this project aims to illustrate the flow of data packets from one device to another, helping users understand the underlying mechanics of network communication.

## Tools and Technologies 📢
Cisco Packet Tracer: A powerful network simulation tool used to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks.
## Network Components 💻
PC: Acts as an endpoint device where data packets originate and terminate.

Server: Provides various network services to client PCs.

Wires (Ethernet Cables): Used to physically connect network devices.

Packet Sniffer: Captures and analyzes network traffic to monitor packet flow.

Switch: Connects multiple devices within the same network, facilitating packet forwarding based on MAC addresses.

Router: Connects different networks and directs data packets between them using IP addresses.
## Features 💡
Network Topology Visualization: A clear representation of how various network devices are interconnected.

Packet Flow Demonstration: Visualizes the journey of data packets as they move through the network.

Traffic Analysis: Utilizes a packet sniffer to capture and analyze the flow of data, providing insights into network performance and potential issues.

Interactive Learning: Users can interact with the network topology to observe how different configurations impact packet transfer.
## Installation and Setup 🎬
To get started with the Campus Network Traffic Visualizer, follow these steps:
