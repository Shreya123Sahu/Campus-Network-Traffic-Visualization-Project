# Campus Network Traffic Visualizer
## Overview :dark_sunglasses:
Welcome to the Campus Network Traffic Visualizer project repository! This project is a fundamental visualization of a campus network topology, demonstrating how packets are transferred between various devices. The primary tool used for this visualization is Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Description :smile:
The Campus Network Traffic Visualizer provides an insightful look into the dynamics of network traffic within a campus setting. By simulating a typical campus network environment, this project aims to illustrate the flow of data packets from one device to another, helping users understand the underlying mechanics of network communication.

## Tools and Technologies :loudspeaker:
Cisco Packet Tracer: A powerful network simulation tool used to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks.
## Network Components :computer: 
PC: Acts as an endpoint device where data packets originate and terminate.

Server: Provides various network services to client PCs.

Wires (Ethernet Cables): Used to physically connect network devices.

Packet Sniffer: Captures and analyzes network traffic to monitor packet flow.

Switch: Connects multiple devices within the same network, facilitating packet forwarding based on MAC addresses.

Router: Connects different networks and directs data packets between them using IP addresses.
## Features :bulb:
Network Topology Visualization: A clear representation of how various network devices are interconnected.

Packet Flow Demonstration: Visualizes the journey of data packets as they move through the network.

Traffic Analysis: Utilizes a packet sniffer to capture and analyze the flow of data, providing insights into network performance and potential issues.

Interactive Learning: Users can interact with the network topology to observe how different configurations impact packet transfer.
## Installation and Setup :clapper:
To get started with the Campus Network Traffic Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Cisco Packet Tracer**: 
   - Visit the [Cisco Networking Academy website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) to download the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone this repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/campus-network-traffic-visualizer.git
     ```

3. **Open the Project in Cisco Packet Tracer**:
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Open the `.pkt` file included in this repository to load the network topology.

## Usage :computer_mouse:

Exploring the Network:
- Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer to observe real-time packet transfer.
- Interact with the devices to send and receive packets, and observe how data is routed through the network.

Analyzing Traffic:
- Utilize the packet sniffer tool to capture and analyze packets.
- Monitor network performance.
